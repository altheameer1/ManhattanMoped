# ManhattanMoped

This program, written in Java for NYU's Introduction to Computer Science course, allows the user to drive a virtual moped through the streets of Manhattan using inputs in the console. The program tells the user where they are on Manhattan's grid every time they make a movement. When the user reaches the cross-streets of certain pre-set NYC landmarks, the programs outputs a message about that landmark.
